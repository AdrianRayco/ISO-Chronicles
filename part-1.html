Beyond doubt, the Quality Management and Planning Department (QMPD) experienced this, and maybe more, since its creation in November 2012 to present. Yet, their fervent passion to lead the Colegio through the challenge of certification was undeniably strong, therefore realizing its vision of making Letran Calamba as the first certified Catholic institution in Laguna. The ISO Chronicles delved into the department’s history and hidden stories shared by Letran Calamba personnel. It is now proven that in the end, they have won the challenge of making Letran Calamba ISO&#45;certified. " width="920" height="157" src="images/u1383-8.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u1487-11" alt="&nbsp;Dr. Maningas, or Zands as she would prefer to be called, was the best candidate for the job after she attended the ISO Awareness Seminar and passed the examination on ISO 19011 Internal Quality Audit at University of Sto. Tomas. After the said seminar, Dr. Zandra was called by the Rector for two things: to share her experiences and to study the benefits of ISO certification once implemented in the Colegio.
Afterwards, the former Accreditation Center organized ISO Awareness and ISO 19011 Internal Quality Audit seminars for administrators on June 27&#45;29 and July 4, 2012. It was during this time that the Colegio first felt the waves of change brought about by ISO. About 96% passed the examination as internal quality auditors; and things happened pretty fast after this. Dr. Maningas started the development of Level 1 Quality Management System Manual, Six Mandatory Procedures and related forms in July 2012. It was then reviewed by the Quality Management Committee (QMC) in August 2012, a committee which assisted in spearheading the ISO 9001 project. The big transformation came in November 2012 when the Planning and Development Department was merged with the Accreditation Center, giving birth to a new department: the Quality Management and Planning Department (QMPD). Dr. Maningas was appointed director, stating, “Since the creation of QMPD, it never stopped in ensuring that the Quality Management System of the Colegio is understood and implemented across all levels/areas of the Colegio.”" width="460" height="468" src="images/u1487-11.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

    <img class="colelem" id="u1484-34" alt="The effect of the sudden change was imminent. Personnel from across departments had their opinion about this. But this was not a surprise to Dr. Maningas. “Any organization that is introducing change in the system would naturally receive both positive and negative comments from its various stakeholders,” she says. “At first, people were interested and excited with the idea. When things were discussed, they gradually stepped back because of the documents that must be prepared and the processes that must be strictly implemented.” Seeing the need for orientation, QMPD wasted no time to address the growing concern among personnel. The following were the initial steps they did for information drive: • A series of orientations and training activities were conducted across all stakeholders including janitors, security personnel, and concessionaires, among many others. • Kapihan sa QMPD was organized to ensure that all queries are addressed in proper forum. It serves as a venue for Letran Calamba stakeholders to be clarified, be informed, and be guided on the implementation of QMS. • The Quality Celebration for different stakeholders was also spearheaded to reach many members of the Colegio. This intensified the reception of ISO 9001 spirit in all school areas. After all these, the question was plain and simple: Did these activities yield a positive result? Apparently yes, because the people soon realized that ISO simplifies things. “Processes are now synchronized and more systematized and functions are now clearly delineated,” Dr. Maningas adds.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u1488-15" alt="&nbsp;“At the onset, I know that my job responsibilities will really be difficult,” Dr. Zandra starts to explain when asked about her duties as QMPD Director at the same time QMR. “It seems that I’m carrying all the luggages and baggages of the entire community.” And indeed, her everyday work routine involves answering queries via phone or personal visit, issuing relevant communications to address concerns, and planning and implementing activities that involves majority of the departments. When asked on how she prepares for it, she replies. “I equipped myself with the necessary tools needed for me to effectively manage the department. I did my homework. I studied all aspects of ISO 9001 and quality management in general. I read books. I read journal articles, particularly experiences of other higher education institutions in the Philippines and abroad. I visited a number of certified companies. I had a two&#45;week immersion at University of Sto. Tomas. I also attended several quality management trainings.” She also readily gives a yes when asked if being QMR was a tough job. “I have to ensure that the QMS is being implemented at all levels, that the QMS is well applied in all departments and offices. I have to ensure that it will not die down because the certificate might be withdrawn or suspended. Also, I have to deal with different personalities of the Colegio. I cannot apply a shot&#45;gun approach because they have different needs and queries.” Another thing that is expected from her as a QMR is the need to analyze quality management&#45;related data. Data cannot just be filed and shelved; it should be processed, analyzed, and reported to the top management. " width="581" height="461" src="images/u1488-15.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
     <img class="grpelem" id="u1489-20" alt="Despite these, there are still exciting episodes for being in the said position. “Whenever a department, an office, or personnel clearly grasps the quality management processes of the Colegio, it excites me. I know someone is learning and applying the process.” Clearly, Dr. Maningas also learned from her experiences. “I learned how to deal with different queries from different personalities,” she says, then quickly adds, “Also, to make quality a foundation for all activities.” The External Audits If there is one person who can never escape the external audit process, it would be her. Dr. Zandra notes the mixed emotions she felt during the audit. “I was excited and nervous. Excited because the QMPD has learned from the process. The staff were able to establish positive relationship with the auditors. Nervous because even though I’m confident that the Colegio will pass the certification, butterflies in my belly attacks me every time a finding is seen by the external auditors.” The announcement that the Colegio has been recommended for certification was, for Dr. Zandra, the most unforgettable among all the things that happened during the external audit. “It made me feel that all difficulties I’ve encountered, all sleepless nights, and all weekend work were worth it.” She believes that the certification will not have been possible without everyone’s help. Collaboration and understanding among the members of the Letran community was the most important factor for a goal’s realization. “Teamwork made the certification possible,” she quips.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u1483-17" alt="&nbsp;“The ISO 9001 certification is not yet the end point. The QMPD is still challenged with the continuous improvement of the Colegio’s QMS.” Dr. Maningas tells The ISO Chronicles. “With the certification, the clients will be more assured that their needs are considered. The internal clients like faculty members and employees will be assured that processes will be synchronized. Duplication of work will be eliminated.” Given this, she promises that the QMPD will continue to ensure that quality imprint will be felt in the entire community. In fact, already in the pipeline of QMPD are the continuous improvement of the Colegio’s QMS, application for CHED’s Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA), application for Centers for Excellence and Centers for Development of academic programs, application for Philippine Quality Award (PQA), and continuous monitoring and evaluating services performance, among many others. Dr. Zandra also thanks the top management for their support, especially Father Castigador, the Rector and President of the Colegio. “I will not be this committed and dedicated if the management doesn’t support me, the department, and the project. I am very thankful with the support extended by the Father Rector.” With the Arriba spirit, dedication, and sincerity of the QMPD people, the department will successfully implement the programs lined up in its plans. With Dr. Maningas’ leadership, surely, the road to continuous quality assurance will remain steadfast and progressing. After all, she’s the czar!

However, it wouldn’t hurt if someone more knowledgeable and experienced check and comment for improvement, which is the role of the quality auditor. The tie&#45;up between the University of Sto. Tomas and the Colegio in its common goal of certification was the bridge that ultimately connected Ms. Guia to Letran Calamba. Even then, she saw the strong desire of the people to be certified. “The Letran Community is determined to be ISO certified without any trace of desperation.” She was even asked to handle an orientation&#45;training for internal auditors in preparation for the Colegio’s First Internal Quality Audit. When offered if she would want to take the post as a quality auditor, she agreed, marking the start of her walk across the halls of and the realms of quality assurance in Letran Calamba.

Upon having a first glimpse of the Colegio’s QMS, Ms. Guia has already noted that it is realistic and achievable, because it is a collaboration effort among the different department, from top to bottom. As for personnel, she said, “Generally, the Letran Community is willing to embrace the QMS, but a few are hesitant, maybe because of the ‘initial’ burden that the Colegio (each individual) has to go through.” She did not have problems penetrating into the system, and in the run getting to know the people of QMPD, who she thought at first were very serious people. “That was only during the first visit, though,” she says with a hearty laugh. The quality visits were one of the initial steps of the QMPD to assist the departments in their preparations for the external certification audit. It was Ms. Guia who did these, which in turn familiarized her with the whereabouts of the departments or offices. When asked how people react to her presence, she comments that the people are welcoming and accommodating. “They were not hesitant to ask questions or clarify things. They were also open to suggestions and comments.” As it unfolded, the quality visits turned out to be helpful to departments. This, Ms. Guia explained, made her learn to appreciate the job. “I am able to connect with people, have the same goal, and [together] improve the system.” She also gained learning and significant experiences she knows will be proven useful in the long run.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u1493-20" alt="&nbsp;As a part of QMPD, Ms. Guia also has her share in preparing the exhibits and necessary documents, which would be checked during the audit. Those times will be remembered because it was amazing how they (QMPD) were able to still have fun despite the workload and considering the extended work time. Asked about which part was most difficult, “The hardest part, in my opinion, is the documentation. There were also few things that need immediate attention.” Despite this, she was certain that the Colegio will surpass it. “I was 100% confident,” she says with conviction. During the real audit, she just knew that everything will go as planned, and she was not mistaken. “I am happy for and proud of Letran. The certification was a collaboration effort and each Letranite can claim that they have contributed to what it has achieved.” She goes on by saying, “It is the determination and dedication of each Letranite, that they have pushed themselves, despite the hardships and demands, to do what was asked, to improve the system for the love and service of Letran.” Now that Letran has surpassed the ISO certification, she knows that whatever the Colegio envisions itself to be in the future will certainly happen. In retrospect, ISO certification seemed a far&#45;fetched dream, yet it was realized. “I believe its people made it happen.” Thankfully, Ms. Guia is one of these people who, in a short span of time, has helped the Colegio achieve a milestone as immense as this. She had undeniably left a mark as the woman who visits, checks, and recommends even more, all for the spirit of sustaining the quality that is now established, and certified, in Letran.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2386-10" alt="Ms. Merly did not expect that her role as a document controller would be this pivotal. It was a huge responsibility to carry on her shoulder. At first, it seemed easy, but as things went by and the processes became clearer, her task, on the contrary, became complicated. “It’s like I’m a gate keeper of codes,” she narrates, having seen almost all QMS manuals of departments—seeing the forms, process maps and work instructions, quality procedures, and departmental manuals—made her feel like reading the profile of Letran. There is no doubt in Ms. Merly’s mind that there is no room for error in her job. This made her become more conscious of her actions. She said that many things can happen in the process, and mistakes can be committed. She feared of many things, such as committing mistakes on codes and re&#45;working them, voluminous documents to process, retrieving and updating manuals from time to time, and the pressure to deliver on time. “The fear of committing a mistake that might affect the certification of the Colegio scared the hell out of me.” The gravity of the work finally dawned on her, but she endured to face it with positivity. If there is anything Ms. Merly is thankful of for her appointment as DC, it would be the life’s lessons she got from it. “[It] taught me to be really patient, that things will not go on their way unless you act on it. My DC experience [also] reduced my carelessness.” More so, she realized that the different departments of the Colegio are connected and are indeed parts of an entire system. “My output will be the input of all the serviced departments and offices,” she declares." width="461" height="476" src="images/u2386-10.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

She adds that there might be errors that can be traced back to her, and that really made her feel squimish (her term when she feels jitters). “But as the hours progressed,” she adds, “I felt relieved that it would be over soon.” And when the Colegio was certified, she was one of the firsts to feel the decreasing pressure and increasing joy. She says that the Colegio has again proven that it has the “spunk” when it focuses on its goal and concentrates to attain it. Now that the Colegio gained the certified status, she can now go back to her normal life, gradually, she says. So when asked which of the stamps she is using would she rather be, she chose the uncontrolled stamp, so she could “take a breather, re&#45;charge, and be back again.” " width="540" height="289" src="images/u2408-12.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

She also knows that certification is not the end, but merely the beginning. “The Colegio needs to sustain its certification,” she shares, and part of which is the monitoring and evaluation of the accomplishments of the different departments, which she’ll do as a Planning Officer. Surely, there are still more to expect for the coming years when it comes to sustaining the QMS that has already been put into place. But the people of Letran need not worry about it, Ms. Merly says. For now, she advises everyone to enjoy what we’ve worked hard for to achieve and think that we are already part of history, including her, of course. On a high note, she cheers proudly, “Well, well, well I’m part of history now, what can I say?”

    <img class="colelem" id="u2432-12" alt="Gil came to QMPD first, in April 2013. He shares that, though he is new, he is not entirely a stranger to ISO. He was a student assistant under the St. Martin de Porres Scholarship Program from 2008, and was an SA until he graduates. “I was immersed already in such certification and accreditation efforts as an SA in Letran, especially since the office kung saan ako unang nag&#45;duty ay sa Office of the VPAR (Vice President for Academics and Research). Nasundan yun ng offices na lahat under ng ARD: SEAS, BED, at Admissions and Scholarships Office. Kaya nasanay na ako.” His employment as Department Assistant of the department also serves as a “reunion” with Dr. Maningas, the director, who was also his immediate supervisor as an student assistant at the OVPAR. “It seems the only thing new [for me] will be the pressure I’ll have once we start sailing the course,” he adds. On the other hand, Kevin was hired during the latter part of June, joining Jonathan Morales, another Letran alumnus, as QMPD Clerk. His primary function was on the creation of Process Maps and Work Instructions (PWs) of departments, which at the time was still far from completion. He admits that, at first, there were hesitations. “Iniisip ko noon kung karapa’t dapat ba ako dun sa position at kung kakayanin ko ang trabaho.” He took the job and was happy, though this job and the nature of it were all new to him. “It’s difficult for me to adjust,” says Kevin, who needed to familiarize himself with forms, manuals, and document codes, not to mention establishing rapport with his officemates and members of the community.

He had to think of ways to approach the intended audience, the students, and make them more aware of ISO. “An advantage I may have is that I still can relate to the students because of my age, kaya I was able to contribute on ideas on how to reach out to them.” As for Kevin, making Quality Proceduress and Process Maps and Work Instructions proved to be tricky. “Yung pag&#45;analyze sa mga policy [ang mahirap] dahil dapat alam na alam mo na yung mismong policy bago ka makabuo ng QPs and PWs. Magkamali ka ng isa ay apektado na ang buong proseso. Kaya dapat siguradong alam mo dapat yung policy bago gumawa.”

They coordinated with key persons to ensure smooth flow of audit: food, transportation, accommodation. They have their own stories to tell as well, which they shared to the ISO Chronicles. During external audit, Kevin, like anyone else, is nervous. “Natatakot akong matanong dahil baka mali ang maisagot ko. Buti na lang hindi ako natanong ng hindi ko kayang sagutin.” In the end, he realized that it should not be the case. “Naisip ko hindi dapat silang katakutan dahil tao din sila at hindi naman nangangain ng tao,” he adds in jest. Probably, it would be his attire every visit which he wouldn’t forget easily when recalling the audit experience. “Hindi ko naman lubos akalain na sa tuwing may visits ay kakulay ko ang lamesa. Kung anung kulay ng table ay kakulay din ng suot kong damit.” Sure enough, that is something hard to forget.

All thoughts came at once: Yung auditors, yung pagsundo, si Kuya Tom! Lagot ako kay Ma’am!” Thankfully, his overstay at “slumberland” did not cost Letran its certification.

True enough, they have experienced working late at night or during the weekends. And often, they are not in the office, but outside giving communications or manuals. They get to tour the entire campus several times already, Ria’s blouse having some wardrobe ‘runs’ one time she was carrying a bag full of QMS Manuals. They also had a new bestfriend: the photocopying machine. At times, they would photocopy one document after another for hours. Luckily for QMPD, these two do not complain!

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2506-12" alt="They have not directly interacted with the external auditors during the visits, yet it did not make them invincible from getting butterflies in their stomach. Just like their fellow QMPD folks, they got nervous. Ria shares she feels this sudden surge of panic especially when she greets the auditors. “I really got nervous because there might be an instance that they will ask me if I know what’s the Mission, Vision, etc. of the Colegio.” Carlo, meanwhile, admits he maintains silence during audit, very unlike his usual self during regular days. “It’s like every word you say can be the reason to not get certified.” At the end of the road, certification was announced, and they were as happy as well—for QMPD and for Letran. “I feel that every effort was rewarded,” Carlo says. Ria sympathizes with the rest of the community. “Yes, I [also] feel so blessed that I am a part of the Colegio’s certification.” Indeed, both Carlo and Ria serve as the legs that keep the communications moving. Without them, probably, the transactions will stop, and the entire system will collapse. As mentioned for countless times now, the certification entails that the Colegio maintain what was started. Therefore, QMPD will soon be on the move again, fast. Fortunately, these two are here to stay, at least until they graduate!
