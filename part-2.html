    <img class="colelem" id="u2525-15" alt="The Colegio’s drive to be ISO certified was just unstoppable in itself. Despite its original schedule being on the second half of the decade, initial opposition experienced, and hesitations flying from everywhere as to whether Letran will be certified in a year’s time or not, the application for certification was pushed through. Once this was set, the clock for Letran Calamba started to tick slowly, each minute lost means a moment closer to the external audit. And before we even realized what had happened, it was already November 28, 2013, a Thursday, the last of the two&#45;day certification audit handled by a five&#45;man team from TUV SUD PSB Philippines. A few minutes later, M302 was already filled with cheers and applause as Mr. Alan Fabella, lead auditor, announces that Letran Calamba is recommended for certification after having met the requirements for the ISO 9001:2008 standard.
End of story… Well, think again. The process continues on to the surveillance visits and to the common objective of maintaining what has been started. But as all these are still up ahead, it would be better to look back on the journey that Letran as one community took hand&#45;in&#45;hand. The next pages will unfold some of the stories you didn’t know existed in the process. Feel free to laugh, agree with, empathize, and most especially learn from every story and statement, and everything that may come in between as the questions get answered. How did everyone prepare? What activities were done to make the dreaded three&#45;letter word ISO more interesting and helpful? What happened during audit? The answers lie on the bridge that comes in between application and certification, the bridge that we passed through to claim the aspired victory.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2528-15" alt="On June 27&#45;29 and July 4, 2012, the former Accreditation Center, facilitated the ISO Awareness and ISO 19011 Internal Quality Audit seminar for administrators. It is during this activity that a new breed of internal auditors was born after an intense examination where 96% of the takers passed. These passers underwent more rigorous and in&#45;depth training activities, workshops, meetings, and likely preparations to serve Letran in a new perspective: in the lens of quality audit. But back then, no one yet has a crystal clear picture in mind of what happens in Letran Calamba when it finally pursues certification. Ms. Mary Ann Liboon, Assistant Director of the Admissions and Scholarships Office, is one of those who haven’t seen yet its repercussions. “Hindi ko pa to nakikita during the training kasi hindi pa nagsi&#45;sink in sakin, eh. Parang ang goal ko lang muna is makapasa… dahil dun sa exam.” Ms. Loriemel Ferrera, Dean of the School of Computer Studies and Technology (SCST) shares that though she already saw the positive effects it would have for Letran, there was one thing she missed out to consider: the work. “Di ko pa na&#45;foresee na it would be that hectic. Kasi kasabay siya ng aming regular operations. And immediate yung application.” " width="460" height="425" src="images/u2528-15.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2554-24" alt="In fact, the reality that ISO can also be applied for by schools and colleges did not manifest to most at first, including Ms. Maresann V. Garcia, Director of the Student Development and Services Department. “At first, akala ko hindi applicable sa Letran, sa academe. Kasi most are geared towards manufacturing. Then I realized it is possible, with the product being the students,” she said. In spite of this, they underwent the seminar, and participated in workshops facilitated by Mr. Edison Pike and Rev. Fr. Arthur Dingel, O.P. When they learned they would also have to take the internal quality auditors’ examination, it took most of the administrators by surprise. Ms. Maria Lim, Accounting Department Director, revealed, “Ako, personally, akala ko training lang siya, as in training lang, walang bearing, walang mangyayari… without knowing na yan pala ay may exam. Aba’y antagal tagal ko na kayang hindi kumukuha ng mga exam na yan. Syempre, medyo tense.” M301, the venue where the said seminar&#45;workshop took place, was suddenly transformed into a classroom with students cramming and reviewing for the exam. Majority of them were holding a copy of Ms. Evelyn Nabus’ notes during the lectures. “Meron siyang summary na binibigyan ang administrators ng kopya,” Ms. Lim shares. No different were they from students when they took the exam; they were very focused on and aimed towards passing the exam. The aftermath of the examination was ecstatic, each comparing with the other’s answers like ordinary students would do after taking particularly difficult examinations.

One of them, Ms. Ricamela Palis, Director for Culture and Arts, also shared some of the confusions and frustrations felt during the in&#45;house seminar. “Para ako’ng kumakain ng bato. Hindi ko talaga ma&#45;digest.” Ms. Palis also shares some experiences during their workshop, where they were the only ones from the academe. It was hard. “Kasi ang ISO talaga is designed for the industry. The participants in that training comes from companies, mostly industries, kami lang talaga yung galing sa school, so tipong one size fits all yung ginawa niya, nung resource person.” To ensure she will fully understand the topics, she seized all the opportunity she can get to ask. “There was much interaction between the resource person and the participants because the open forum was the time to address the specific concerns of the participants based on the nature of their organization.” However, the Ms. Palis was also thankful for the diversity of participants during their time for the workshops. “Yun yung advantage namin, kasi nagkaroon din kami ng appreciation ng ISO in the context of the industry.” " width="560" height="289" src="images/u2573-9.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

Ang sinasabi nga sakin ng mga pari, ‘Tatahi&#45;tahimik ka, tapos ngayon 100 ang makukuha mo sa exam?’ So I was recognized for that.” In fact, 96% of the first batch and 100% of the second batch of takers were qualified as certified internal quality auditor. “Akala ko [nun] tapos na,” says Ms. Lim, who was just happy she was able to pass. But when she, as well as the other administrators, were told in advance that they will receive appointment papers as internal auditors for the First Internal Quality Audit, the gravity of the ISO certification hit them. “Pumasok lang lahat nung nagpe&#45;prepare na,” said Ms. Liboon. And while they were preparing for it, the top management was already cooking something: a new department which would later handle the ISO certification.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2605-15" alt="Aside from the time element, another concern then was the voluminous documents that would be generated. Ms. Irish Aranzaso, HRM Laboratory Assistant, shared that schools really have a lot of paper. “Naisip ko na mas mahirap kasi mas marami tayong departments compared sa isang company na nasa isang building lang yung offices, kunyari sales, marketing, admin. Mas madami siyang dapat kailangan na documents kasi bawat process hawak ng ibang department. Bihira ang centralized.” Because of these matters, and the need to make the community get acquainted with ISO, one of QMPD’s first activities is an orientation which also aims to encourage the stakeholders to embrace the good change which is coming. However, the acceptance did not come in an instant. Ms. Nelda Javier from the SCST admits that ISO means one thing for her at the time: “Trabaho.” And bloody work at that! However, in time, the personnel had something to look forward to because of ISO. Ms. Jelhen Faylon of the Office of the Rector and President said, “Mas maayos na documents, mas pulidong mga procedures. Mas mahigpit.” Meanwhile, Mr. Michael Jade Wania, BED High School Guidance Assistant, mentioned that “We try to aim high sa pagiging ISO certified.” Another step to make selected administrators more familiar with the ISO processes was the benchmarking visit at the University of Sto. Tomas on February 8, 2013 (Friday). The group was composed of members of the Quality Management Committee, a task force appointed to help review and implement the QMS. Engr. Felimar Resplandor, Director of the Property Management and General Services Department (PMGSD), shared that there was a pressure during benchmarking. “Mako&#45;compare mo yung procedures mo sa iba. Sila ganito yung ginagawa. Tayo? Pressure yun.” " width="516" height="510" src="images/u2605-15.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2610-17" alt="OBut knowing these aren’t enough, QMPD initiated more activities to encourage free forms of questioning about their ISO&#45;related concerns. Thus, the conception of the Kapihan sa QMPD, a one&#45; to two&#45;hour activity scheduled every Thursday starting at 3:00 p.m. This was launched in May. Interested clients would only have to reserve for schedule, as each Kapihan only accommodates up to ten (10) people. Ms. Rhodora Maunahan from the School of Nursing (SN) admitted she liked the activity. “Para kasing hindi lahatan yun. Halimbawa, kami, Nursing lang. Makakapagtanong talaga kami ng para sa [concern] ng Nursing. Parang normal lang na usapan, nagkukwentuhan lang.” Ms. Tagulinao adds, “Light siya. Parang kwentuhan lang. Maiintindihan mo yung dapat mo’ng gawin at the same time relaxed yung atmosphere. Hindi ganun ka&#45;serious. After nun, talagang naintindihan namin.” This was probably the reason why Mr. Romeo Banatlao, CMD Director, insisted that CMD staff attend the Kapihan. “Nung nakita niya yung memo sa Kapihan, sinabi niya agad na makakakuha tayo ng insights kung paano gagawin ang mga bagay ng maayos. Dapat mag&#45;ganun tayo, sabi niya,” Ms. Tagulinao narrates. Why this activity is rated 10 out of 10, Ms. Maunahan has an answer. “Feel at home environment. Hindi siya nakakahiya [magtanong] kasi konti lang. Hindi restricted.” However, all of these were only preliminary, as the First Internal Quality Audit was off to make its way, right at the heart of the problem: documentation.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2616-15" alt="Documentation ensures that the processes are followed step&#45;by&#45;step. The documents serve as proof that indeed, what’s written in the quality procedures is what’s practiced by the departments. That is probably the reason why departments were jolted up awake to the fact that they need to organize their filing system so that documents would be protected and traceable. Ms. Jori Lace Rufon of the Grade School shared that they basically focused on four things: manuals, systems, documents, and records. She also revealed relying on the list of 21 Records as guide for the documents to prepare, a strategy also done by Ms. Elizabeth Pegano of the Research Department. “Nagbase [kami] sa QMPD guidelines,” she says. Ms. Dahlia Lanceta of the Corporate Communications and Marketing Department (CCMD) said she had to revisit her files several times. “Madami akong ginawa… Inayos ko yung files,” she would say. Even Ms. Estrada also noticed these bulks of pulp. For the Training Needs Assessment (TNA) alone, she already has five active forms, on top of which is the Individual Development Plan (IDP) and IDP Registry, separate forms as well, totaling to seven forms. These were checked during the external audit. “Honestly, I got overwhelmed with paper works.” " width="920" height="289" src="images/u2616-15.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

Several strategies were also formed to ensure the documents needed will be complete come audit time. Mr. Vicencio already used checklists for the submittals. “Yung submittals dapat kumpleto, monitored.” With the large scope of the office, he is just thankful for the support of his co&#45;workers. “full support naman sila, sina Mam Rhoda (Dr. Ma. Rhodora Odejar, VPA) at Ms. Ey (Ms. Rodelyn Badulis).” The School of Engineering has their own techniques as well. Ms. Jennifer Dorado shares it with ISO Chronicles. “Ginawa kasi namin, meron kaming chair and faculty submittals… na nasa kanila. Lahat ng office&#45;related, nasa amin.

They also take time to understand the coding system, which they admitted to still being accustomed to. “Kasi syempre, it would take a lot of getting used to, bago mo magamay.

Local government compliance natin, halimbawa sa Bureau of Fire, Department of Labor and Employment, Laguna Lake Development Authority, Environmental Management Bureau, Department of Health, as well electrical requirements, local municipality’s requirement for building code, water potability, water sewage disposal.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u2652-8" alt="So they did their own research of the external standards before they create their policies which, also, must be aligned with the internal standards. They set guide questions to check the processes. “Kailangan tingnan kung ano ang nangyayari? Kaya ba ng tao to? Ng sistema, kung anong structure na meron tayo, yung organization? Pag in&#45;implement ba natin ang procedure na ito ay kumbaga magsa&#45;swak ba sa existing structure?” Taxing it is, yet Engr. Resplandor and his team does not easily give up. “Hangga’t hindi natatapos, hindi kami natigil.” Lastly, Ms. Shirley Macatangay, School Nurse, shares the way she prepared the Medical and Dental Clinic (MDC). Since this is not just an ordinary office, the treatment is different. “You have to prepare in all angles of the school clinic,” she starts. “Unang una ang facilities… Cleanliness, dapat well maintained. Clinic ito, hindi basta office. Yung arrangement na hindi crowded, filing, records section, authorized person lang ang pwedeng maghold ng susi. Pagdating sa paper works, yung files.” She does these since the MDC does not have a department assistant and, aside from the Chair Dr. Jonathan Ibalio, because she is the only permanent personnel there. She does not complain however, for the love of Letran!

This was even more complicated that ensuring documentation, as this also involved money and expertise. One must be knowledgeable and skilled to calibrate equipment—which varies from thermometers to weighing scales to boilers and ovens. The HRD, QMPD, and Management Accounting and Finance Services Department (MAFSD) joined forces to ensuring equipment for the different laboratories are calibrated and the respective in&#45;charge are skilled. On August 27, 2013, a Calibration Training was held at M302. Guest speakers from the Department of Science and Technology imparted the essentials and importance of calibration, which was appreciated by the participants. “Maganda siya kasi nabigyan kami ng idea kung gaano ka&#45;importante yung calibration,” says Mr. Nestor Sienes, BED Laboratory Assistant, who was one of the attendees. Ms. Aranzaso, on the other hand, took matters into her own hands. “Nung may nagka&#45;calibrate [sa hotel], nagtanong na ako sa kanila tapos nagpaturo ako sa kanila.

This is the first party audit conducted by the organization itself for management review and other internal purposes. It checks whether departments/offices conform to the requirements set by the ISO 9001:2008 standards, external standards, and the Colegio’s procedures. Auditing and being auditors are not new for them. Even before the ISO venture, the Colegio already had the Operations Audit. However, it could be said that this present time’s audit is more intense and more process&#45;based. No wonder people have considerably panicked over the news of audit. The First Internal Quality Audit of the Colegio was scheduled from June 25 to August 30, 2013. Three days are allotted for audit on each department/office. Four audit teams were composed to render auditing services to the four divisions: Academics and Research, Administration and Planning, Finance, and Religious Education, Mission, and Identity.

On the other hand, Ms. Ferrera was still undergoing some adjustment. “To tell you frankly, since bago pa din naman ako sa pagiging dean… hindi pa ako ganun ka&#45;oriented with the process of other divisions. Hindi ko pa alam paano sila tumatakbo. I was hesitant because I might not be able to perform it well. Hindi pa ako ganun ka&#45;boka. Kasi strict ako, eh. Eh I don’t want naman to offend people.

Despite orientations and briefings that they may attend to, the fact remains that being an auditor, indeed, is not easy. They would have to study early on the profile as well as the processes of their auditee. They have to ensure completeness of the materials that would be needed. They had to take the examination. They would have to temporarily leave their posts in their respective offices for almost a month, and, has the tendency to extend working hours to finish the reports they must generate, audit reports and corrective action notifications among them. Ms. Lim’s concerns if she’ll be gone for almost a month immediately knocked her door when she got the audit schedule. “Ang naisip ko na kaagad nun, paano yung mga trabaho, matatambak, kasi yung trabaho ko, trabaho ko lang talaga. Hindi ko naman mabigay sa ibang staff ko kasi may kanya kanya din silang trabaho.

    <img class="colelem" id="u2783-32" alt="There are three unforgettable moments shared during the internal quality audit which you might be delighted to hear! Here they are: 1. Ms. Garcia said that every day is new day. It is because there is no rule of thumb for all departments. “Kasi iba yung experiences and circumstances sa bawat department,” that is why they adapt according to the department. 2. Mr. Vicencio said that he already had once a manger or sabsaban in the office made from the shredded papers. With the retention period of documents and records, he has to make sure that the files kept are only those prescribed, according to their matrices of documents and records. So he proceeded to shred those that are not needed, and he was able to keep enough shredded documents to form a manger. But isn’t it too early to talk about Christmas? 3. Ms. Macatangay had an encounter during the IQA that somehow proves that luck sometimes has a hand on things. “Sabi sa akin ng auditor (Ms. Garcia), ‘Okay, patingin nga po ng outgoing logbook. Pili ka ng number ng letters.’ Ako pa ang namili. ‘Mam, Letter number 15’, kasi 15 ang birthday niya. Sabi niya, ‘Mam, patingin nga po ng logbook at patingin ng letter na may stamp. Pagdating sa logbook, walang received. So sabi ko, ‘Ay, lagot wala!’ Hint na yun. Pero nareceive ng MAFSD, sa MAFSD addressed yun eh. […] Of all letters na pinili ko, yun talaga ang wala, 15.” I bet this wouldn’t be Ms. Macatangay’s favorite number for quite some time.

Ms. Guia Anne Torres had one job in particular: visit the departments, simulate audits, check whether the documentations abide with the standards set by the 9001:2008 standards, and recommend points for improvement. Sounds plain and simple, right? Well, it isn’t. Neither is it easy for the departments who would have to prepare for her visits. The Quality Visit is a form of mentoring and coaching.

However, the strings of orientation held in November 2012 and the exhibit during the WQD helped him understand more. “Nagkaroon [pa ako] ng pang&#45;unawa pa sa quality na kailangan sa ISO.” To make the exhibit more interactive, and to encourage stakeholders to share their inputs, a freedom wall dubbed as “wall speaks” was put up. As a sort of a contest, each visitor was enjoined to answer the question “What is your own definition of quality?” They would write their answers on the provided metacards and post them on the wall. Medium of writing was not restricted. Students from different programs and year levels visited the exhibit. Administrators, employees, faculty members, guests, and even parents provided their answers. As a result, hundreds of original definitions were gathered from the responses posted at the freedom wall. After the week&#45;long exhibit, the 170 definitions were ranked by the members of the Quality Management and Planning Committee based on content, organization, and style. After which, the ten (10) definitions which are highest in rank were awarded with prizes and freebies. " width="920" height="306" src="images/u2912-16.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

One of the strategies of the department in facilitating this leg of the quality celebration is for the QMPD personnel to personally visit the faculty members in their respective faculty rooms. Each department was visited separately by the QMPD where ISO re&#45;orientation was held in the form of fun and meaningful games. The games were as follows: GAME 1. Sets of questions were prepared in connection with ISO. Each question, when answered correctly, corresponds to a certain number of points. Whoever gets the correct answer will be awarded an I Stand Out Card; one card is equivalent to one point. At the end of the game, whoever gets the most number of points wins. GAME 2. Volunteer faculty members will fill in the missing words of the institutional quality policy. Whoever gets all ten (10) missing words or gets the highest number of correct answers win. The games, Ms. Rhodora Maunahan of the School of Nursing admitted, were her favorites. “Masaya, gusto ko yun. Ang saya saya nun. May challenge kasi.” Mr. Esberto shares the same enthusiasm with the concept of challenge. “Nakaka&#45;challenge yung pointing system, kung sino’ng mananalo.” Ms. Laarni Pesigan of the School of Education, Arts, and Sciences, agreed. “Na&#45;enjoy ko yun.

Natuto ka na, nagenjoy pa, may prize pa.” Ms. Javier was auspicious to bag the top prizes for both games during the WQD Celebration for their department.

One of the management principles of ISO 9000 is customer focus. Customer satisfaction is the outcome received by the clients who have experienced the performance in fulfilling their expectations. Letran Calamba adheres to this principle by ensuring the creation and retention of satisfied clients. With this, it becomes axiomatic that customer satisfaction has to be monitored. It is one of the measures of management system performance. The first actual client satisfaction form released was then a simple feedback mechanism devised by two offices: Corporate Communications and Planning Department (CCPD, now CCMD) and Office of the VP for Academics and Research (OVPAR, now OVPA). However, seeing that this is a major consideration for ISO, the Quality Management and Planning Department (QMPD) released the new institutionalized ISO format of the Client Satisfaction Survey Form in November 2012.

Specific objectives include: • Measuring the service from the personnel;
• Measuring the service/requested document from the department or office;
• Measuring the rate of the overall service received; and
• Getting comments and suggestions from the customers. Data were collected from the client satisfaction forms administered monthly. There are two ways of collecting the accomplished forms. 1.

To document the collected forms, CSS Retrieval Form (AP:03&#45; 00&#45;FO&#45;44) is duly signed and accomplished by QMPD and the concerned departments. 2.

The highlights of the conducted CSS from June to May 2014 can be seen in the succeeding page (Figure 1). Rev. Fr. Honorato C. Castigador, O.P., Rector and President, and Dr. Zandra N. Maningas, QMPD Director, awarded the Certificate of Achievement to departments which received Excellent rating monthly. Certificate of Recognition was given to the departments/offices, which consistently received an Excellent CSS rating from June to September 2013 (Figure 2). The awarding was held during the Rector’s Hour on October 22, 2013 held at M302, St. Martin de Porres Building. For AY 2013&#45;2014, 17.14% (6/35) departments were consistently evaluated “Excellent” by their clients from June 2013 to May 2014 (Figure 3).

Castigador, O.P., Rector and President of Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba, only has this word to describe the entire process the Colegio went through, and probably endured, to attain its endeavor of ISO certification. There were voluminous documents, sleepless nights, and confusions, which according to Fr. Castigador were almost terrible. And yet, after the certification was announced, the entire journey was unquestionably worth it and indeed terrific, in the truest sense of the word! The audit which was conducted to ascertain Letran Calamba’s compliance with the standards was done with the Colegio’s external registrar and new partner for quality assurance: TÜV SÜD PSB Philippines. It is a service provider for a comprehensive and integrated suite of product testing, inspection and certification services. It was established 140 years ago in Germany and started its Philippines operation more than 11 years ago with the aim of helping companies achieve business excellence.

As a result, they have already certified various institutions and companies, in particular with the ISO 9001 standard—now including Letran Calamba. The first leg of the external audit was during the pre&#45;assessment audit on October 10&#45;11, 2013. The Colegio sought help for the pre&#45;assessment to check whether the Colegio has already met the standards or still has some documents to prepare or processes to observe. The findings for such do not have any bearing for the Stages 1 and 2 audit. It’s only meant to help the Colegio further improve. External auditors were led by Ms. Katrina Joy Bicomong as the lead auditor, ably assisted by Mr. Xavier Lance Dy and Ms. Pamela Maye Gunay. About 90.91% of the departments were audited, including the core processes: document control; internal audit; curriculum and syllabus design and development; instruction; library; facilities management; " width="920" height="215" src="images/u3162-11.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

A total of 30 findings were noted by the auditors. About a month after pre&#45;assessment, it could be said that the real audit has arrived! The whole Letran community geared up for the Stage 1 (Document Review) Visit on November 13, 2013. The one&#45;day document review was done once again by TUV SUD auditors. The Colegio welcomed back Ms. Gunay and Ms. Bicomong, with Ms. Gunay now the lead auditor. The audit team assessed the documentation of the Colegio’s procedures, process maps and work instructions, and other pertinent documents that come with it. Four observations were noted by the external auditors. Again, they recommended Letran Calamba for Stage 2. On November 27&#45;28, 2013, the auditors returned for Stage 2 Certification Visit. Mr. Alan Fabella was lead auditor. Part also of his team were the returning auditors (Ms. Gunay, Ms. Bicomong); Mr. Edison Pike, who was also the one who handled the seminar for administrators in 2012, and Mr. Charlie Labrador, who consequently was the mentor of Dr. Zandra Maningas during the Lead Auditor Training Course she attended in Davao City. There is a plethora of tales and narrations, stories, and narratives that came with the external audit. With their abundance and richness, they all boiled down to one thing: happy ending!

    <img class="colelem" id="u3192-17" alt="And so the narration goes... Once upon a time, in an institution which is Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba, an external audit took place to achieve the ISO 9001 certification. Its people had mixed emotions during this time. Some were happy. Mr. Infante for one said, “Natutuwa kami sa ganyang certification/accreditation dahil sa mga nakikita nila na pwede pang i&#45;improve na naaksyunan.” A few others were happier. “Masaya… masaya siya,” said Ms. Liboon. The Admissions and Scholarships Office was able to build rapport with the auditors Ms. Gunay and Mr. Pike, having engaging conversation with them, and her personnel having their own unforgettable moments. “May bloopers sina Art [Madridejos] at Sheryll [Casunuran]!” Whatever these are, it would be safer for The ISO Chronicles if you ask them personally. There is also excitement, to the point of not being able to concentrate. Ms. Ferrera shares that during the pre&#45;assessment visit, when no schedule was given beforehand as to when auditors will paying their visit, the whole department were torn between thrill and anxiety. “Since we don’t know kung sino ang pupuntahan, hindi kami, ako personally… hindi ako makagawa ng trabaho ko kasi tuwing bubukas yung pintuan, [tumitingin kami].” Yet, most of the personnel were nervous, Ms. Faylon among them. “Kinabahan. Sumakit kaya ulo ko. Nalaglag puso ko.” Ms. Rufon adds to this, saying “Para kang may butterfly na lumilipad sa tiyan mo.

Hindi ka pwedeng magpa&#45;cute cute lang.” Still, she keeps calm and positive. “Confident pa rin dahil na&#45;audit naman na kami (during internal quality audit).” Others exuded more confidence during the audit. Ms. Estrada, during Ms. Gunay’s audit during the Stage 2, said she trusted her instinct. “Malakas ang loob ko kasi during the first audit with TUV SUD na wala akong maipakitang document [nung hinanap niya], I was able to show her (Ms. Gunay) the memo na pinagko&#45;comply ko yung mga tao at yung hinahanap niya ay isa sa mga nakalista. [I think] that was enough for her not to put it in writing na finding kasi alam niya na may ginawa kami. At the back of my mind, naisip ko na tama yung naging idea ko na memohan ang mga taong to kasi hindi man sila mag&#45;submit, may maipapakita ako sa auditor na ginawa namin to make sure na magsa&#45;submit, kaya lang hindi ko hawak ang tao.” Talking about instincts, Ms. Ferrera has another story to share. “Two days before the visit, hindi ako makatulog. Nagigising ako ng madaling araw. Naisip ko, yung isang faculty na hindi pa nagsubmit ng syllabus. Sabi ko, ‘Feeling ko mabubunot yung kay Sir Joell.’ And tama, nung pumunta siya (Mr. Pike) dito, nabunot yung subject ni Sir Joell. Buti na lang naipagawa namin yun sa kanya a day before, tinulungan namin siya ni Sir Edison.” " width="920" height="272" src="images/u3207-12.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u3220-15" alt="However, there are some who felt that the odds were not in their favor. “You can never be prepared. Nagkakataon talaga na kung alin ang hihingin ng auditor,” Ms. Garcia shares. Engr. Resplandor can’t help but concur. “Hindi talaga na&#45;perfect. Walang 100% sa system. Kaya pagdating sa audit, meron at merong makikita.” Mr. Sienes, with a trace of despondency in his voice, even said “Sa lahat naman ng meron, yung wala pa ang nahanap.” Ms. Macatangay also shares how the odds didn’t particularly side with them that day. As the audit day was a Thursday during the Stage 2 Certification Audit, there is a scheduled testing of the generator. When the audit was about to end, the lights went out, stopping everyone on their tracks. Without emergency lights, all they saw was darkness.
Moreover, when the auditor inspected the trash can for infectious wastes, there were paper cups, which Ms. Gunay pointed out. Ms. Macatangay. who strictly monitors the disposal of wastes in the Clinic, was furious. That was the first time someone threw the trash in the wrong bin. “Ngayon pa!” It just so happens that there was an emergency, that’s why she had to leave her post momentarily. “Hindi ko matanggap, nakakainis, nakakaloka! Napaiyak talaga ako.” she said. To resolve the issue, she placed another bin meant only for paper wastes. Now, that’s immediate corrective action! Moreover, one department was not visited: Culture and Arts Department. Despite this, they know they have prepared for the visit and were prepared should the auditors come. Ms. Ricamela Palis, the director, stated, “We are [still] part of the system. Kung hindi kami nag&#45;ayos, magma&#45;manifest din yun sa ibang mga departments. You are contributory para maayos ang buong sistema.” " width="461" height="510" src="images/u3220-15.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

    <img class="colelem" id="u3245-14" alt="Some personnel of audited departments were relieved since they were not asked directly by an auditor. Ms. Pegano said, “Nag&#45;assist lang kami, support. Kung ano yung hinihingi nilang papers, yun yung binibigay namin sa kanila. [Though] syempre kami din, kaba kaba din kami.” However, most were not, as they say, fortunate enough. Some were asked questions which took them at the edge of their seats. One of the janitorial personnel, Mr. Ramon Morales, was asked about the Colegio’s vision. “Kinabahan ng kunti, pero nakasagot naman. Memorize ko po talaga yung vision,” he proudly shares, pertaining to that brief moment when he and the auditor came face to face and he was asked the golden question. Ms. Dahlia Lanceta of CCMD was asked point blank about the quality objectives. “Syempre, natakot, namutla. Gusto ko’ng atakihin. Mame&#45;mental block ka. Gusto mo na’ng lumabas, make an excuse para hindi makapagrecite, kasi nakakatakot.” Just when she thought her ordeal was over, another question popped out from Mr. Pike: Who is the Colegio’s Quality Management Representative? Good thing, she knows. “Naalala ko na nareview ko siya… so nasagot ko naman ng maayos na siya si Dr. Maningas.” Apparently, however, that question became a dreadful one for a few. Mr. Marion Coronel, Supervisor of the All Around Services and Merchandising Corporation, the agency which provides Letran Calamba janitorial personnel, was surprised with the question, which came last after a series of process&#45;related queries. “Nabigla ako kasi hindi naman ako sanay sa term na QMR. Ang alam ko QMPD. Salamat sa Diyos, siguro ginuide niya din ako, at ang sagot ay nasa tabi&#45;tabi lang,” referring to Dr. Maningas of course, " width="920" height="289" src="images/u3245-14.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

     <img class="grpelem" id="u3261-18" alt="who was with Mr. Fabella, the lead auditor, who asked the question to him. Mr. Michael Jade Wania, when asked the same question, was tensed. “Nung una, kabado ako,” he said, considering he was just asked previously of work&#45;related questions. “Nung unang tanong niya, iba ang pagkakaintindi ko. Ang pumasok sa isip ko, sino ang recipients or pinaglilingkuran mo bakit may ISO certification. Ang nabanggit ko tuloy, mga estudyante. Di nagtagal, sabi ko, ‘Wait lang.’ Nagkatinginan kami ni Mam Jenna [Rivera&#45;Capulong]. Sinabi ko kay Sir (Allan), ‘Sir, pwedeng bawiin? Si Mam Zandra pala!’” Of course, the process of audit was spearheaded by QMPD. But they couldn’t have made it without help from allies. One was Ms. Sharmae “Moi” Madlangbayan of CCMD, who handled the documentation of the audit together with her DOKYU people. She was happy to be of help by being the woman behind the lens. If there’s something she would not forget, it would be during the Stage 2 Audit when there was simultaneous audit of PMGSD and SCST. “Dahil kulang sa tao, kulang sa gamit, kailangang magmadali para makuhanan yung mga moments na dapat i&#45;document. Hindi naman pwedeng, ‘Ay, pwedeng ulitin?’” If she was able to manage that, she sure would do as well in marathons and fun runs. Aside from capturing moments, Ms. Moi also tried to help during the actual audit. “Natulong discreetly sa simpleng paraan tulad ng pagkuha ng documents.” She would assist the department being audited whenever she can, including her own department. In a nutshell, she said the entire experience was “Nakakapagod, pero worth it naman.” " width="460" height="544" src="images/u3261-18.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

    <img class="colelem" id="u3282-10" alt="Another would be Mr. William Sagge, or Kuya Tom, the official driver to the auditors. He would wake up early in fetching the auditors and stay up late on the road when the auditors are to return home after audit, all while enduring the heavy traffic. He is part of the Management Accounting and Finance Services Department (MAFSD), headed by Mr. Rosario M. Palomeno, from where transportation, food, and other supplies are coursed through. Surely, QMPD couldn’t have survived the journey without MAFSD! There were other allies as well. The janitorial services were there to assist in “putting up and tearing down” the exhibits. Lead man Luis Irang was one of the people who replaced the signage of the classrooms and offices in the wee hours of the night to ensure that they are updated, hours before the visit. Aside from this, they also had to memorize the philosophy and objectives of Letran, to which he thanks the distributed ID&#45;sized cards. “Malaking tulong po [yung cards]. Nalalaman ko yung mission saka yung vision ng Letran, although alam ko na, pero mas nalaman ko pa. Ang kagandahan pa, habang naglilinis kame na&#45;memorize din namin,” Kuya Luis shares. His fellow “blue boys” and “blue girls” also familiarized themselves with the mission and vision statements. “Hindi lang i&#45;memorize, kundi alamin yung ugat,” Kuya Marion advised his people.
The security personnel were also there to support. They, too, experienced preparing for the external audit. Mr. Lochinmar Ortilla, Guard Supervisor of Grandeur Security, knew that they would have to participate in the preparations. “Syempre, involved kami, kasi kami ang front liner, kami yung nasa harap eh.” All security personnel did the same thing as the " width="920" height="255" src="images/u3282-10.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

Pag may visitors, kahit kapag time ng PACUCOA, ready naman po kami. Tsaka na&#45;orient naman po kami ng department namin.” These unsung heroes—the janitors and guards—deserves not only a warm applause but pats on the back. We would also have the selected HRM students who served food during the audit. Mr. Jhon Paul Sta. Ana, president of The Hospitality Management Student Society or THOMASS, one of the Recognized Student Organizations of the Colegio, said it was an honor to be of service. “Syempre, yung mga officers ng THRMI ay willing naman gawin anything lalo na sa community service. Then pag may ganitong klaseng [event], lalo na for accreditation na yung Letran for ISO, pwede na din namin na maipagmalaki na naging part kami nung proseso. Tapos yun na rin yung tulong namin sa QMPD para mas tutok sila sa kailangan nilang gawin.” Since they would be in the venue where the auditors stay, they might as well be asked some questions, to which they replied, “May ibinigay naman ang QMPD na nilalagay sa ID, so laging nasa amin yun, lagi kaming nire&#45;remind na babasahin, kaya ready naman kami sakaling matanong. Pero nakakakaba pa rin naman na matanong pero malakas naman yung loob namin.” There are more stories to tell, perhaps; stories that would pass from one person to the next, from a group to another, but what would probably be one of the best stories of Letran Calamba to share was what had happened the night of November 28, 2013.

    <img class="colelem" id="u3365-9" alt="And what did this certification give us? All personnel would agree that it would be the improvements in terms of documentation, organization of records, provision of services, and quality of education. “Dati, puro kami si tradition, practice… [Ngayon] documented na talaga,” Ms. Lim notes. Even the Grandeur felt the relief of better office filing. “Na&#45;ayos yung files and documents,” says Ms. Evelyn Asia, one of the female guards in Letran, who also arranges files of the SSO and maintains their own logbooks, which by the way are also registered and controlled. Ms. Faylon emphasizes the big change she saw as far as documents and tracing is concerned. “Sa documents, malaking malaki ang naitulong ng ISO. Naging organized ang mga tao. Pag humahanap ng certain document, mabilis nilang nalo&#45;locate. Kasi lahat coded. Tapos nakalista in and out.” As a student, JP Sta. Ana is happy that Letran has finally achieved certification. “Yung diploma kasi natin… hindi talaga siya actually na, parang nagagamit abroad. Parang nadi&#45;disregard. Pag ISO [certified], sinasabi na nami&#45;meet ng school na ito yung standard na pang buong mundo na hinahanap through education. [Kaya] Sobra! Sobra! Bilang lang ang schools sa Pilipinas [na ISO&#45;certified sa ngayon]. Hindi ganun karami ang certified na schools sa Pilipinas. So para sa akin sobrang proud ako na dito sa Letran may ganun.” " width="920" height="221" src="images/u3365-9.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->

    <img class="colelem" id="u3380-12" alt="Ms. Berna Evalle, 2008 alumni who graduates with the degree in Bachelor of Elementary Education with specialization in Pre&#45;School Education, felt there was also a change in terms of service. “Mas mabilis ngayon. Kaysa dun sa time namin. Pero ngayon maayos na.” Amidst the hype of the celebration, the entire Letran Calamba community gathered as one to witness the ceremonial receiving of the ISO 9001 certification: the testament of the fruit of labor of every stakeholder. This awarding ceremony was held last January 23, 2014 (Thursday) at the Fra. Angelico Hall (New Gymnasium). It started with a mass at 10:00 a.m., with the Rector and President himself, Rev. Fr. Honorato C. Castigador, O.P., as mass presider. After the mass, the awarding ceremony began. It was hosted by Mr. Airon B. Aguirre of the Management Accounting and Finance Services Department. Part of the ceremony is the imparting of message from Letran Calamba and TUV SUD, represented by Ms. Celeste M. Bitong, Certification Manager, Ms. Maria Cecilia E. Tejada, Marketing and Customer Service Manager, and Mr. Marlon M. Palisoc, Account Consultant for South Luzon, as well as the actual handing over of the certificate.

     <img class="grpelem" id="u3395-28" alt="On the other hand, the certification also poses challenges to Letran Calamba and its people. Mr. Esberto, SCST Faculty, says there are big expectations now that Letran is certified. “Syempre masaya, pero at the same time, kumbaga anlaki ng challenge na haharapin namin gawa nung standardization hindi lang sa… office procedures pero syempre, kasama na dun yung sa way ng pagtuturo namin at tsaka nung requirements sa teaching.” Maintaining this status is what Ms. Liboon mentioned. “Yung pagme&#45;maintain ng certification, kasi sayang naman yung naumpisahan.” She adds that there should be improvements in the next visits, particularly the surveillance. “Mas maganda kung sa surveillance visit, wala na masyadong findings, kumbaga, kasi mas nag&#45;improve na tayo. Yun yung main objective ng ISO eh, yung ma&#45;improve yung sistema. So kumbaga tayo, as member nung Letran community, kung kaya pa nating ma&#45;improve yung sistema na meron tayo, mas maganda.” Mr. Marion Coronel, Supervisor of All Around Janitorial Services, also gives a short but meaningful statement. “Hindi porke na&#45;certify na ay titigil na.” Truly, the end of the certification process is just the beginning of a longer road towards sustaining the implementation of the standard. “Maging continuous… talagang maging kasama na sa work attitude sana ng lahat… hindi lang dahil may magche&#45;check na taga&#45;labas,” says Ms. Lim. Ms. Estrada agrees with her. “Kailangang makita na isinasabuhay natin, ginagawa natin,” only to be seconded later by Ms. Ferrera. “It should be a way of life. It would be a lot easier to prepare documentation if this really happens.” The same thing was said by Ms. Palis when asked about her recorded philosophy and objectives. “I hope the time would come na hindi na siya kailangan i&#45;play… kasi na&#45;internalize na yan ng mga tao. Matutuwa ako if that day would come. I would rather see it in action, in the improvement in the system, kaysa nire&#45;recite lang.” Ms. Almoro of SBMA hopes that monitoring and safekeeping have already improved. Ms. Estrada tells The ISO Chronicles that there are also faculty concerns about workload which divides their time with teaching, something they also believe will subside now that we are already certified. Ms. Liboon also believes that intensifying orientation should be done, especially to parents, which could also be a form of marketing the Colegio. Well, the whole community was able to surpass certification, so it would surely overcome whatever it comes its way, as long as there is unity and commitment among everyone! Indeed, the journey has been a roller&#45;coaster ride. Yet, in the end, the collective efforts of everyone paid off! With this new milestone, Letran Calamba continues to prove its unending commitment to accessible and high standard education, responsive operations towards customer satisfaction, and real quality service. With pride, dignity, and, honor, we say: Arriba! " width="664" height="756" src="images/u3395-28.png"/><!-- rasterized frame -->
